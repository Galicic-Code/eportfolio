									<p>Thank you Prannoy and Amy for your posts.</p>
									<p>Prannoy highlighted the fact that budget and finding experts are two common issues in Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) when it comes to Industry 4.0.</p>
									<p>He also mentioned the term “disruptive innovation”, which applies to companies which “disrupted” the “traditional” ways to do business. For example, companies such as Air B&B and Über are very successful, however, they do not have their own infrastructure (i.e. their own hotels or car fleet), and hence it might be easier for them to “disrupt” the traditional market. For “brick and mortar” companies “disruptive innovation” might have a different meaning. They have to think about “innovating” their existing infrastructure or products they produce, and innovation means and impacts them differently, especially if they are SMEs. They will meet with technological challenges fairly quickly and will have to make smart prioritised decisions, as ‘digital innovation’ might have a direct impact on their business.</p>
                  <p>SMEs will have to shift their thinking from products into service (Ericson et al., 2020) and re-think how to get their products to the customers as efficiently as possible by following their location and completion status (Schröder, 2016). They will have to find new ways into digitalisation and change their business model, i.e., they will have to have highly collaborative teams and be adaptable and resourceful to be and to stay competitive (Safar et al., 2018), most likely more than ever before. The ‘smart industry’ concept of Industry 4.0 is user-centric, and the users expect that the products will ‘fit’ their needs (Ericson et al., 2020).</p>
                  <p>Amy mentioned the challenges around the staff competencies. It will be very costly for SMEs to invest in staff if they have high staff turnover. It will therefore be better for SMEs to invest in keeping highly skilled workforce by offering them additional benefits, bonuses or company shares in return for successful and secure business performance.</p>
