										<h1>Discussion Forum 1 Summary Post</h1>

									<p>Thank you Prannoy, Sayam and Emmon for your responses. The initial post was about the impact of WannaCry ransomware hack on Deutsche Bahn’s passenger information displays. The trains kept running, which has shown some resilience between the train systems and passenger information displays, however, it caused a major disruption to passengers.</p>
									<p>Good points were made that Deutsche Bahn should have a well-prepared recovery plan in place, they should map out their threat landscape, and have intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems in place to detect and react to anomalies in the network. Deutsche Bahn are one of many companies in the world who are still using (and relying on) new and old (legacy) systems. The list of legacy systems probably goes just beyond old unpatched Windows XP computers, which is, by the way, still ran on more than 5% of Windows operated computers in the world (Hilary, 2017). It probably also includes railway signalling systems, operating centre network systems, train braking systems, amongst others, which are all safety critical. Actually, one of the non-safety critical systems in the railway domain seem to be passenger information displays and ticketing systems, which, if affected, can cause major disruption to passengers, and can have an impact on a company’s reputation and loss of revenue.</p>
									<p>Performing a comprehensive risk assessment would need a well structured and area-specific approach. On the one hand, technical cyber security defences would need to be put in the right place to be efficient. On the other hand, Deutsche Bahn employees would need extensive upskilling and knowledge on how to recognise and respond to attacks like WannaCry. Deutsche Bahn were not prepared at all for this kind of attack (Vlad, 2017), and preparedness plans for such events are a basic start in risk mitigation.</p>
									<p>Rail simulators such as SecureRails would definitely help with further mapping of cyber-physical gaps, especially because researchers can simulate different attack scenarios (Teo et. al, 2016). Such simulations would help rail operators like Deutsch Bahn with understanding vulnerable areas, it would strengthen the gaps in the system, and help with developing suitable strategies against such an attack (Vlad, 2019).</p>
									<p>Furthermore, it would be interesting to see how Deutsche Bahn improved their cyber security, what types of intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems they had put in place, what strategies they developed and if they upgraded Windows XP computers with the latest version of Windows operating system since this incident.</p>
