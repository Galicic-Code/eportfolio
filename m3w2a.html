                  <p><b>Weekly Activity</b></p>
                  <p>The answers to the following questions were prepared after reading the Spears & Barki (2010) "User Participation in Information Systems Security Risk Management (2010)":</p>
                  <p><ol type="a">                 
                  <li>How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?</br></br>
Qualitative assessment – Interviews (classification and connection form basis for theory development; data can be coded – open ended / axial coding)</br></br>
Quantitative assessment – to test the theoretical model, apply hypothesis testing; pre-specify outcomes; more constructive approach (which fits specific theory / framework); results were explanatory rather than derived from analysis</br></br>
Both methods – rich context & testability of study; possible to cross-validate the results</li></br>
                <li>What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?</br></br>
Involving users in the risk management process enables examining psychological and affective outcomes such as involvement, attitude, intention, and acceptance & active involvement in the research study.</li></br>
                <li>Based on the findings of the research,<ol type="i"> 
<li>How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?</li></br>
It might result in skewness of data and might not be accurate enough.  Data might be “too” US specific & might be different in other regions of the world.</br>
<li>Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?</li></br>
Mots likely, as they both complement each other.</br>
<li>How might you mitigate any issues encountered?</li></br>
Have the right amount of people involved (with the right skillset and experience), i.e. the target population (reach out to people through campaigns & by using a different database, not only through emails, as they has a relatively low response rate).</br></br>
Also individual level replies might be slightly different to organisation-level replies, as many participants may not have the knowledge of those areas, e.g. finance – a global assessment is suggested at the end of the paper.</br></ol>

									<p>Hi Steve,</br>You raised two good points: financial risks and data security risks. This is aligned with the research by Kazemargi and Spagnoletti (2020), who looked at the gap between Industry 4.0 and financial issues the Italian Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) are facing. While SMEs are dependent on the interconnectivity of devices and systems, they are facing cyber-security issues of data in their supply chains (Kazemargi and Spagnoletti, 2020). They often have to trade-off between investing into specialist technologies and training their employees, and struggle with mitigating against cyber-attacks, which can have a negative impact on their reputation (Kazemargi and Spagnoletti, 2020).</p>
									<p>Sustainability also seems to be an issue of Industry 4.0. According to Bai et al. (2020), Industry 4.0 can reduce energy consumption through electronic component recycling, as well as reduction of resource consumption (Ejsmont et al., 2020). This can, however, increase the electronic waste and cause an impact on employment, depending on the type of technology used (Bai et al., 2020).</p>
									<p>Interestingly, Jamai et al. (2020) list three main attack surfaces in Industry 4.0: systems, devices and networks, leading to attacks on industrial systems and their components, including sensors, actuators, valves, etc. Sensors, for example, can serve as protection measures to ensure workers’ safety. If compromised, this could lead to serious workplace accidents.</p>

									<p>Hi Nabil and Antonios,</br>Based on the points you both raised, I expanded my research into the issues around the Industry 4.0 concepts exercised by Amazon and Tesla.</p>
									<p>For example, the use of unmanned drones for package delivery was a rather challenging project by Amazon. While it might disrupt door-to-door package delivery to half an hour, the use of such drones can bring several physical challenges, as well as the potential for cyber-security attacks, such as signal jamming and data injections (Sanjab et al., 2017). Further issues are registration of drones with the Federal Aviation Administration in the USA, safe design, permissions for flying drones, and licencing (Sherr, 2020). It seems that the ability of developing such advanced technology is here, but it is hard to bring it to reality due to these issues. Can we call this a disruption of a disruption?</p>
									<p>Another example is Tesla’s ‘big’ challenge of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Tesla's cars. It seems that the concept of self-driving cars includes AI making complex decisions (Ajitha and Nagra, 2021), mimicking 'thinking' and 'reacting' like human drivers would. However, the concept of decision-making of self-driving cars has severe ethical issues. Holstein et al. (2018) researched a decision-making process in an unavoidable scenario of a car accident, where AI had to choose between driver’s life or driving over a pedestrian with a different persona (child, an elderly person or a sick person). Also, severe environmental issues exist around rechargeable lithium-ion batteries Tesla is using, making them very toxic for the environment (Costa et al., 2021). Unfortunately, most of rechargeable batteries end up on landfill rather than being recycled (Costa et al., 2021). Is this yet another disruption of making humans 'more comfortable' at the cost of safety, security, privacy, and environmental issues?</p>
