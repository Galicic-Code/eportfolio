												<h3>Reflective piece</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This module had a changing pace, with a combination of weekly activities (i.e., regular reading), seminars (and the preparation for the seminars, which is captured throughout this e-portfolio), as well as working on two assignments in a team, with people I have never met or worked with before. The team dedication was absolutely fantastic, and we worked very well in a team - like a team of soldiers!
The module provided me with an insigt to qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, diffrent threat modelling techniques, the legislative challenges aroudn risk modelling (especially with the compliance with different standards in different countries), as well as the principles and practical applications of DR strategies and the challenges around the DRaaS. It was a very comprehensive module, and definitely challenging in terms of trying to fit a lot in a limited space of the assignments, but was enjoyable in terms of the topics covered, and the team performance, which was an absolute pleasure.</p>
