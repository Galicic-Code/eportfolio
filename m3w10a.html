									<p>Hi Antonios,</p>
                  <p>Thank you for a very interesting post. I would like to highlight two items: bias in scoring, and the depth of the results.</p>
                  <p><b>Scoring bias</b></p>
<p>We can perhaps assume that different vulnerability scores in CVSS are based on a bias, similar to the biased risk analysis Hunt & Naweed (2023) researched in a workshop setting. The first is cognitive bias (as a result of conscious or sub-conscious mental processes) and the second is motivational bias (which impacts risk judgment). This can lead to understated, skewed risk estimates (Hunt & Naweed, 2023). It would be interesting to see if this can be applied to cyber risk management environment, in the same way as in the ‘traditional’ industries, such as chemical industry, oil & gas, mining, etc.</p>
                  <p><b>Depth</b></p>
                  <p>Instead of a 10-point scale, the CVSS scale perhaps needs a different approach, for example, the principle of pairwise comparison weighted scores, like in NASA-TLX (Hart & Staveland, 1988), used for workload assessment. NASA-TLX has been scientifically proven numerous times and has been applied in multiple safety critical domains since its beginning. The weighted results of the six dimensions can provide more depth and context to each assessed dimension (i.e., scale), and this would perhaps add more depth to the application of CVSS.</p>
                  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>           
									<p>I agree with you that CVSS needs further improvement with scientific justifications. Hopefully numerous trials will be able to improve it.</p>

									<p>Hi Matjaz</p>
<p>thank you for a very interesting and comprehensive post. I particularly appreciated your summary of options. I would argue that although CVSS may be a defacto standard it is certainly NOT a ratified and backed by any standards body. What do you think about the argument that CVSS is fundamentally flawed - due to the reasons you pointed out about its underlying numerical basis and its lack of homogeneity across its range/ scale?</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>I completely agree that CVSS is "fundametally flawed", however, so much thoughts and work have gone into it to improve it, i.e., so many variations have been developed even after its last version, that it might actually evolve into something 'useful', given its original flaws. Perhaps we will be able to apply different variations of the CVSS to different areas in the future, and combine the outputs under some sort of a 'CVSS hybrid model', who knows.</p>
