<p>After reading the article by Barafort et al (2018) and the blog by Kirvan (2021), the following questions were answered:</p>

<p>Which of the frameworks do you think would be applicable to the following organisations:</br>

<ol type="a"><li>International bank</li></br>

Bank would need to comply with the ISO 27001 standard due to its Information Security Management systems (ISMS) framework. Their issues are regulatory compliance, personal confidential information and financial transactions.</br></br>

  <li>Large hospital</li></br>
    
Hospitals deals with personal confidential information and financial transactions (especially if they are a private, rather than a public hospital). They would need to apply the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the USA and compliance with the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 & the Common Law Duty of Confidentiality, if they are based in the UK.</br></br>

   <li>Large food manufacturing factory</li></br>

Besides applying Occupational Health & Safety standards, such as ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems), the best frameworks for food manufacturing factories are the ISO 22000 (Food Safety Management) and the ISO 9001 (Quality Management System)</ol></p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>You raised two good points: financial risks and data security risks. This is aligned with the research by Kazemargi and Spagnoletti (2020), who looked at the gap between Industry 4.0 and financial issues the Italian Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) are facing. While SMEs are dependent on the interconnectivity of devices and systems, they are facing cyber-security issues of data in their supply chains (Kazemargi and Spagnoletti, 2020). They often have to trade-off between investing into specialist technologies and training their employees, and struggle with mitigating against cyber-attacks, which can have a negative impact on their reputation (Kazemargi and Spagnoletti, 2020).</p>

<p>Sustainability also seems to be an issue of Industry 4.0. According to Bai et al. (2020), Industry 4.0 can reduce energy consumption through electronic component recycling, as well as reduction of resource consumption (Ejsmont et al., 2020). This can, however, increase the electronic waste and cause an impact on employment, depending on the type of technology used (Bai et al., 2020).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Jamai et al. (2020) list three main attack surfaces in Industry 4.0: systems, devices and networks, leading to attacks on industrial systems and their components, including sensors, actuators, valves, etc. Sensors, for example, can serve as protection measures to ensure workers’ safety. If compromised, this could lead to serious workplace accidents.</p>

<p>Hi Nabil and Antonios,</p>
<p>Based on the points you both raised, I expanded my research into the issues around the Industry 4.0 concepts exercised by Amazon and Tesla.</p>
<p>For example, the use of unmanned drones for package delivery was a rather challenging project by Amazon. While it might disrupt door-to-door package delivery to half an hour, the use of such drones can bring several physical challenges, as well as the potential for cyber-security attacks, such as signal jamming and data injections (Sanjab et al., 2017). Further issues are registration of drones with the Federal Aviation Administration in the USA, safe design, permissions for flying drones, and licencing (Sherr, 2020). It seems that the ability of developing such advanced technology is here, but it is hard to bring it to reality due to these issues. Can we call this a disruption of a disruption?</p>

<p>Another example is Tesla’s ‘big’ challenge of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Tesla's cars. It seems that the concept of self-driving cars includes AI making complex decisions (Ajitha and Nagra, 2021), mimicking 'thinking' and 'reacting' like human drivers would. However, the concept of decision-making of self-driving cars has severe ethical issues. Holstein et al. (2018) researched a decision-making process in an unavoidable scenario of a car accident, where AI had to choose between driver’s life or driving over a pedestrian with a different persona (child, an elderly person or a sick person). Also, severe environmental issues exist around rechargeable lithium-ion batteries Tesla is using, making them very toxic for the environment (Costa et al., 2021). Unfortunately, most of rechargeable batteries end up on landfill rather than being recycled (Costa et al., 2021). Is this yet another disruption of making humans 'more comfortable' at the cost of safety, security, privacy, and environmental issues?</p>
